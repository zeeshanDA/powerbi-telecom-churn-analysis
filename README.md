# powerbi-telecom-churn-analysis

## 🚀 Overview
This Power BI project explores customer churn patterns for a fictional telecom provider (Databel). 


## 🔍 Objectives
- Understand churn trends across customer demographics and contract types
- Identify key drivers behind customer churn
- Visualize churn patterns by geography using map visuals
- Develop dynamic DAX measures and calculated columns for deeper analysis

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains information about:
- Customer demographics (gender, age group, location)
- Services used (internet, phone, streaming)
- Account details (tenure, payment method, contract type)
- Churn status

*Note: This is a fictional dataset provided for learning and portfolio purposes.*


## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI**
- **DAX** (DISTINCTCOUNT, IF, SUMX, etc.)
- **Excel** (for data preprocessing)

## 📈 Key Features
- Created calculated **columns** and **measures** to capture churn insights
- Used **IF formulas** to segment customers by churn risk
- Built interactive **map visualizations** to display churn by region
- Designed KPIs and visuals to track:
  - Total customers
  - Churn rate
  - Tenure analysis
  - Service impact on churn

## 💡 Key Insights
- Customers with month-to-month contracts showed the highest churn rates
- Shorter-tenured customers were more likely to churn
- Geography and service type influenced churn likelihood

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Building DAX measures for business metrics
- Using map visuals for geographical insights
- Structuring a data story around business problems
- Improving dashboard design for business users
